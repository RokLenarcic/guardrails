;; ADR: Printing to *err* during the compilation process breaks with nREPL, so we don't
;;
;; gnl:
;; The reason we're no longer printing to *err* below is due to an obscure nREPL
;; issue where doing it in this manner during the process of loading namespaces
;; appears to break the latter when using a Cursive (1.13.1-2023.3) remote REPL
;; with nREPL (1.1.0). Whether this might affect other nREPL client/server
;; combinations is unknown. Since Guardrails can emit various messages during
;; this process, this can lead to very strange and difficult to debug failures
;; completely unrelated to any errors in the actual code. Using `(.println
;; System/err ...)` does not seem to have this effect, however it only prints to
;; the terminal where the nREPL server is running, rather than the nREPL client
;; (which has been a known nREPL issue in various environments).
;;
;; If someone with the necessary courage, pain tolerance and free time on their
;; hands should feel the need to delve into this at some point in the future,
;; here's a basic repro that should make things blow up:
;;
;; - Uncomment everything related to `*err*` below and correctly wrap the
;; relevant forms in `binding`
;; - Require `com.fulcrologic.guardrails.core` in the `user` namespace
;; - Define a `com.fulcrologic.guardrails.core/>defn` function in some namespace
;; in your application
;; - Launch an nREPL server with this deps.edn alias:
;; :clj {:extra-deps {nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version "1.1.0"}}
;;       :main-opts  ["-m" "nrepl.cmdline"]}
;; - Create a Cursive remote nREPL run config and execute it
;; - Load the namespace where you used `>defn` and watch the process die quietly
;; in the REPL right after Guardrails tells you that it's been enabled
;; - Simply removing the `[*out* *err*]` bindings around `println` makes it work
;; again.
;;
;; If you only require `com.fulcrologic.guardrails.core` in the namespace where
;; you use `>defn`, you should be able to make it fail only on the first load
;; attempt (when the initial Guardrails messages are printed), and complete
;; successfully on subsequent attempts (when Guardrails is quiet).
;;
;; For now, given the above as well as the long and ongoing history of various
;; stderr-related nREPL client and server issues, we're simply no longer
;; printing anything non-fatal to stderr.
